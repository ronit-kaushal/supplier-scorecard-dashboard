# Supplier Scorecard Dashboard

**Primary Tools:** Power BI · DAX · Power Query  
**Data:** Synthetic / Anonymized  

---

## 1. Business Problem

Staffing organizations often work with multiple vendors, making it difficult to objectively evaluate supplier performance across responsiveness, quality, SLA adherence, and delivery outcomes. Without a standardized scorecard, supplier reviews can become subjective and reactive, limiting effective vendor governance.

---

## 2. Objective

Design an executive-ready **Supplier Scorecard Dashboard** to:

- Enable objective comparison of staffing vendors using standardized KPIs  
- Identify high-performing and underperforming suppliers  
- Support data-driven supplier governance and quarterly performance reviews  
- Highlight operational risks and improvement opportunities  

---

## 3. Dataset Overview

- Synthetic dataset replicating multi-vendor staffing operations  
- Includes job postings, supplier responses, submittals, starts, finishes, and SLA timestamps  
- Structured to support performance scoring, ranking, and trend analysis  

---

## 4. KPIs & Metrics

- Overall Supplier Score (out of 100)  
- Response Rate and First Response Time  
- Submittal-to-Start % and Successful Finish %  
- Failure-to-Start %  
- Market Share and Activity Volume  
- SLA Adherence and Efficiency Indicators  

---

## 5. Approach & Tools

- Designed a KPI-based **supplier scoring framework** using weighted performance metrics  
- Normalized metrics and applied threshold-based scoring logic using DAX  
- Implemented comparative ranking and peer-level analysis across suppliers  
- Built an executive-neutral scorecard layout focused on clarity and governance  
- Used Power Query to prepare analytics-ready datasets  

---

## 6. Key Insights (Illustrative)

- Supplier performance varies significantly across responsiveness and delivery quality  
- High-volume suppliers are not always top performers on SLA and start success  
- Ranking views help quickly identify consistent performers and high-risk vendors  

---

## 7. Business Impact / Decisions Enabled

- Supports structured supplier performance reviews and governance discussions  
- Enables leadership to identify suppliers for growth, remediation, or rationalization  
- Improves transparency and objectivity in vendor performance evaluation
